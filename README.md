# CYT2 (Cyber Youth Think Tank)

**Empowering the Next Generation of Cybersecurity Leaders**

The **Cyber Youth Think Tank (CYT2)** is a youth-focused initiative under the Cyber Education, Research, and Resilience Foundation (CERRF). It addresses the urgent cybersecurity skills shortage in London by nurturing, engaging, and empowering young people aged 12–25—particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. Through interactive workshops, hackathons, and think tank sessions, CYT2 equips participants with the technical knowledge and hands-on skills needed to thrive in today's digital landscape.
